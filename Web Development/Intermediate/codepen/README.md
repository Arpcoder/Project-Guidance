## How to get started
- #### Clone the Repository
    - First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:
       
               git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

- #### Navigate to the Project Directory:
  - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, etc.) and run:

          cd repository-name
- #### Install Dependencies:
  - React projects typically have dependencies listed in a package.json file. You need to install these dependencies using npm (or yarn if the project uses it). Run:

           npm install

- #### Start the Development Server:
       npm start

  #####  This will start the development server and open the React application in your default web browser.
